## Authentication

All LinguaNova Translator API endpoints require authentication using a custom header. To authenticate, include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for every request.

Here is an example of how to include the header in your API calls:

```http
GET /translate HTTP/1.1
Host: api.linguanova.live
x-api-key: your_api_key_here
```

Make sure to replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key. If you do not have an API key, please contact support to request access.

For example, here is how the `security` specification might look in OpenAPI format:

```json
"security": [
  {
    "x-api-key": []
  }
]
```
